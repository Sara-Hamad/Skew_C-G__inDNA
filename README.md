## **Skew of C & G inside DNA**

Replication of DNA starts at an area called ORI (origin) ,this code could give a rough idea about where it might be 

the ori segments the DNA into two parts ,befor the ori  -revers half strand-  and after the ori  -forward half strand- 

-the revers half has higher cytosine and lower guanine

-the forward has higher guanine and lower cytosine

by notcing the signefficant drop in cytosine and the increasing guanine you may have passed the ori ,with further analysis you could find where it is
